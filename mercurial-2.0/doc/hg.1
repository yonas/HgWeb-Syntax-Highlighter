.SH COMMANDS
.SS add
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the
repository.
.sp
The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To
undo an add before that, see \%\fBhg forget\fP\:.
.sp
If no names are given, add all files to the repository.
.sp
An example showing how new (unknown) files are added
automatically by \%\fBhg add\fP\::
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ ls
foo.c
$ hg status
? foo.c
$ hg add
adding foo.c
$ hg status
A foo.c
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-I,  \-\-include
.
include names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-X,  \-\-exclude
.
exclude names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-S,  \-\-subrepos
.
recurse into subrepositories
.TP
.B \-n,  \-\-dry\-run
.
do not perform actions, just print output
.UNINDENT
.SS addremove
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Add all new files and remove all missing files from the
repository.
.sp
New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in
\fB.hgignore\fP. As with add, these changes take effect at the next
commit.
.sp
Use the \-s/\-\-similarity option to detect renamed files. With a
parameter greater than 0, this compares every removed file with
every added file and records those similar enough as renames. This
option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must
be identical) as its parameter. Detecting renamed files this way
can be expensive. After using this option, \%\fBhg status \-C\fP\: can be
used to check which files were identified as moved or renamed.
.sp
Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s,  \-\-similarity
.
guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)
.TP
.B \-I,  \-\-include
.
include names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-X,  \-\-exclude
.

.UNINDENT
.SS annotate
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg annotate [\-r REV] [\-f] [\-a] [\-u] [\-d] [\-n] [\-c] [\-l] FILE...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for
each line
.sp
This command is useful for discovering when a change was made and
by whom.
.sp
Without the \-a/\-\-text option, annotate will avoid processing files
it detects as binary. With \-a, annotate will annotate the file
anyway, although the results will probably be neither useful
nor desirable.
.sp
Returns 0 on success.
.sp

.UNINDENT
.SS archive
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg archive [OPTION]... DEST
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, the revision used is the parent of the working
directory; use \-r/\-\-rev to specify a different revision.
.sp
The archive type is automatically detected based on file
extension (or override using \-t/\-\-type).
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
create a zip file containing the 1.0 release:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg archive \-r 1.0 project\-1.0.zip
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
create a tarball excluding .hg files:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg archive project.tar.gz \-X ".hg*"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.sp
Valid types are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBfiles\fP
.sp
a directory full of files (default)
.TP
.B \fBtar\fP
.sp

.TP
.B \fBzip\fP
.sp
zip archive, compressed using deflate
.UNINDENT
.sp
The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
using a format string; see \%\fBhg help export\fP\: for details.
.sp
Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
prepended. Use \-p/\-\-prefix to specify a format string for the
prefix. The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes
removed.
.sp
Returns 0 on success.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-decode
.
do not pass files through decoders
.TP
.B \-p,  \-\-prefix
.
directory prefix for files in archive

.UNINDENT
.SS backout
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg backout [OPTION]... [\-r] REV
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Prepare a new changeset with the effect of REV undone in the
current working directory.
.sp
If REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new changeset
is committed automatically. Otherwise, hg needs to merge the
changes and the merged result is left uncommitted.
.IP Note
.
backout cannot be used to fix either an unwanted or
incorrect merge.
.RE
.sp
By default, the pending changeset will have one parent,
maintaining a linear history. With \-\-merge, the pending
changeset will instead have two parents: the old parent of the
working directory and a new child of REV that simply undoes REV.
.sp
Before version 1.7, the behavior without \-\-merge was equivalent
to specifying \-\-merge followed by \%\fBhg update \-\-clean .\fP\: to
cancel the merge and leave the child of REV as a head to be
merged separately.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help dates\fP\: for a list of formats valid for \-d/\-\-date.
.sp
Returns 0 on success.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-merge

.UNINDENT
.SS bisect
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bisect [\-gbsr] [\-U] [\-c CMD] [REV]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To
use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as
bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem
as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision
for testing (unless the \-U/\-\-noupdate option is specified). Once
you have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or
bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset
or announce that it has found the bad revision.
.sp
As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
revision as good or bad without checking it out first.
.sp
If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.
Its exit status will be used to mark revisions as good or bad:
status 0 means good, 125 means to skip the revision, 127
(command not found) will abort the bisection, and any other
non\-zero exit status means the revision is bad.
.sp
Some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
start a bisection with known bad revision 12, and good revision 34:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bisect \-\-bad 34
hg bisect \-\-good 12
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
advance the current bisection by marking current revision as good or
bad:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bisect \-\-good
hg bisect \-\-bad
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
mark the current revision, or a known revision, to be skipped (eg. if
that revision is not usable because of another issue):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bisect \-\-skip
hg bisect \-\-skip 23
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
forget the current bisection:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bisect \-\-reset
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
use \(aqmake && make tests\(aq to automatically find the first broken
revision:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bisect \-\-reset
hg bisect \-\-bad 34
hg bisect \-\-good 12
hg bisect \-\-command \(aqmake && make tests\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
see all changesets whose states are already known in the current
bisection:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg log \-r "bisect(pruned)"
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
see all changesets that took part in the current bisection:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg log \-r "bisect(range)"
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
with the graphlog extension, you can even get a nice graph:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg log \-\-graph \-r "bisect(range)"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.sp
See \%\fBhg help revsets\fP\: for more about the \fIbisect()\fP keyword.

.SS bookmarks
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bookmarks [\-f] [\-d] [\-i] [\-m NAME] [\-r REV] [NAME]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when
committing. Bookmarks are local. They can be renamed, copied and
deleted. It is possible to use bookmark names in \%\fBhg merge\fP\: and
\%\fBhg update\fP\: to merge and update respectively to a given bookmark.
.sp
You can use \%\fBhg bookmark NAME\fP\: to set a bookmark on the working
directory\(aqs parent revision with the given name. If you specify
a revision using \-r REV (where REV may be an existing bookmark),
the bookmark is assigned to that revision.
.sp
Bookmarks can be pushed and pulled between repositories (see \%\fBhg help
push\fP\: and \%\fBhg help pull\fP\:). This requires both the local and remote
repositories to support bookmarks. For versions prior to 1.8, this means
the bookmarks extension must be enabled.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.SS branch
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg branch [\-fC] [NAME]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument,
set the working directory branch name (the branch will not exist
in the repository until the next commit). Standard practice
recommends that primary development take place on the \(aqdefault\(aq
branch.
.sp
Unless \-f/\-\-force is specified, branch will not let you set a
branch name that already exists, even if it\(aqs inactive.
.sp
Use \-C/\-\-clean to reset the working directory branch to that of
the parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch
change.
.sp
Use the command \%\fBhg update\fP\: to switch to an existing branch. Use
\%\fBhg commit \-\-close\-branch\fP\: to mark this branch as closed.
.IP Note
.
Branch names are permanent. Use \%\fBhg bookmark\fP\: to create a
light\-weight bookmark instead. See \%\fBhg help glossary\fP\: for more
information about named branches and bookmarks.

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg branches [\-ac]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
List the repository\(aqs named branches, indicating which ones are
inactive. If \-c/\-\-closed is specified, also list branches which have
been marked closed (see \%\fBhg commit \-\-close\-branch\fP\:).
.sp
If \-a/\-\-active is specified, only show active branches. A branch
is considered active if it contains repository heads.
.sp
Use the command \%\fBhg update\fP\: to switch to an existing branch.
.sp
Returns 0.

.SS bundle
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bundle [\-f] [\-t TYPE] [\-a] [\-r REV]... [\-\-base REV]... FILE [DEST]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not
known to be in another repository.
.sp
If you omit the destination repository, then hg assumes the
destination will have all the nodes you specify with \-\-base
parameters. To create a bundle containing all changesets, use
\-a/\-\-all (or \-\-base null).
.sp
You can change compression method with the \-t/\-\-type option.
The available compression methods are: none, bzip2, and
gzip (by default, bundles are compressed using bzip2).
.sp
The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means
and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull
command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not
available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.
.sp
Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.
.sp
Returns 0 on success, 1 if no changes found.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0

hg cat [OPTION]... FILE...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Print the specified files as they were at the given revision. If
no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
or tip if no revision is checked out.
.sp
Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
given using a format string. The formatting rules are the same as
for the export command, with the following additions:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB%s\fP
.sp
basename of file being printed
.TP
.B \fB%d\fP
.sp

.UNINDENT
.SS clone
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.
.sp
If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source.
.sp
The location of the source is added to the new repository\(aqs
\fB.hg/hgrc\fP file, as the default to be used for future pulls.
.sp
Only local paths and \fBssh://\fP URLs are supported as
destinations. For \fBssh://\fP destinations, no working directory or
\fB.hg/hgrc\fP will be created on the remote side.
.sp
To pull only a subset of changesets, specify one or more revisions
identifiers with \-r/\-\-rev or branches with \-b/\-\-branch. The
resulting clone will contain only the specified changesets and
their ancestors. These options (or \(aqclone src#rev dest\(aq) imply
\-\-pull, even for local source repositories. Note that specifying a
tag will include the tagged changeset but not the changeset
containing the tag.
.sp
To check out a particular version, use \-u/\-\-update, or
\-U/\-\-noupdate to create a clone with no working directory.
.sp
For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the
source and destination are on the same filesystem (note this
applies only to the repository data, not to the working
directory). Some filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking
incorrectly, but do not report errors. In these cases, use the
\-\-pull option to avoid hardlinking.
.sp
In some cases, you can clone repositories and the working
directory using full hardlinks with
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cp \-al REPO REPOCLONE
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The
operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during
the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your
editor breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do
so). Also, this is not compatible with certain extensions that
place their metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.
.sp
Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable
revision from this list:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP a. 3
.
null if \-U or the source repository has no changesets
.IP b. 3
.

Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
.sp
Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.
.IP Note
.
diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
default to comparing against the working directory\(aqs first
parent changeset if no revisions are specified.
.RE
.sp
When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
to its parent.
.sp
Alternatively you can specify \-c/\-\-change with a revision to see
the changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.
.sp
Without the \-a/\-\-text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of
files it detects as binary. With \-a, diff will generate a diff
anyway, probably with undesirable results.

hg graft [OPTION]... REVISION...

Changesets that are ancestors of the current revision, that have
already been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.

If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process is
aborted so that the current merge can be manually resolved. Once
all conflicts are addressed, the graft process can be continued

Search revisions of files for a regular expression.
.sp
This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only accepts
Python/Perl regexps. It searches repository history, not the
working directory. It always prints the revision number in which a
match appears.
.sp
By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a
file in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision
that contains a change in match status ("\-" for a match that
becomes a non\-match, or "+" for a non\-match that becomes a match),

Repository "heads" are changesets with no child changesets. They are
where development generally takes place and are the usual targets
for update and merge operations. Branch heads are changesets that have
no child changeset on the same branch.
.sp
If one or more REVs are given, only branch heads on the branches
associated with the specified changesets are shown. This means
that you can use \%\fBhg heads foo\fP\: to see the heads on a branch
named \fBfoo\fP.
.sp
If \-c/\-\-closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed
(see \%\fBhg commit \-\-close\-branch\fP\:).

If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are descendants of
STARTREV will be displayed.

You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type
text/plain or text/x\-patch). From and Subject headers of email
message are used as default committer and commit message. All
text/plain body parts before first diff are added to commit
message.
.sp
If the imported patch was generated by \%\fBhg export\fP\:, user and
description from patch override values from message headers and
body. Values given on command line with \-m/\-\-message and \-u/\-\-user
override these.
.sp
If \-\-exact is specified, import will set the working directory to
the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the
resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in
the patch. This may happen due to character set problems or other
deficiencies in the text patch format.
.sp
Use \-\-bypass to apply and commit patches directly to the
repository, not touching the working directory. Without \-\-exact,
patches will be applied on top of the working directory parent
revision.
.sp
With \-s/\-\-similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and
copies in the patch in the same way as \(aqaddremove\(aq.

To read a patch from standard input, use "\-" as the patch name. If

.sp
Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory whose
names match the given patterns.
.sp
By default, this command searches all directories in the working
directory. To search just the current directory and its
subdirectories, use "\-\-include .".
.sp
If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names
of all files under Mercurial control in the working directory.
.sp
If you want to feed the output of this command into the "xargs"
command, use the \-0 option to both this command and "xargs". This
will avoid the problem of "xargs" treating single filenames that
contain whitespace as multiple filenames.
.sp
Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

.sp
Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire
project.
.sp
If no revision range is specified, the default is \fBtip:0\fP unless
\-\-follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is
used as the starting revision.
.sp
File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
files. Use \-f/\-\-follow with a filename to follow history across
renames and copies. \-\-follow without a filename will only show
ancestors or descendants of the starting revision.
.sp
By default this command prints revision number and changeset id,
tags, non\-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for
each commit. When the \-v/\-\-verbose switch is used, the list of
changed files and full commit message are shown.
.IP Note
.
log \-p/\-\-patch may generate unexpected diff output for merge
changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset against
its first parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents
will appear in files:.

for performance reasons, log FILE may omit duplicate changes
made on branches and will not show deletions. To see all

Path names are defined in the [paths] section of your
configuration file and in \fB/etc/mercurial/hgrc\fP. If run inside a
repository, \fB.hg/hgrc\fP is used, too.
.sp
The path names \fBdefault\fP and \fBdefault\-push\fP have a special
meaning.  When performing a push or pull operation, they are used
as fallbacks if no location is specified on the command\-line.
When \fBdefault\-push\fP is set, it will be used for push and
\fBdefault\fP will be used for pull; otherwise \fBdefault\fP is used
as the fallback for both.  When cloning a repository, the clone
source is written as \fBdefault\fP in \fB.hg/hgrc\fP.  Note that
\fBdefault\fP and \fBdefault\-push\fP apply to all inbound (e.g.
\%\fBhg incoming\fP\:) and outbound (e.g. \%\fBhg outgoing\fP\:, \%\fBhg email\fP\: and

.sp
Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.
.sp
This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
or URL and adds them to a local repository (the current one unless
\-R is specified). By default, this does not update the copy of the
project in the working directory.
.sp
Use \%\fBhg incoming\fP\: if you want to see what would have been added
by a pull at the time you issued this command. If you then decide
to add those changes to the repository, you should use \%\fBhg pull
\-r X\fP\: where \fBX\fP is the last changeset listed by \%\fBhg incoming\fP\:.

.sp
Push changesets from the local repository to the specified
destination.
.sp
This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull
in the destination repository from the current one.
.sp
By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the
destination, since multiple heads would make it unclear which head
to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge
before pushing.
.sp
Use \-\-new\-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named
branch that is not present at the destination. This allows you to
only create a new branch without forcing other changes.
.sp
Use \-f/\-\-force to override the default behavior and push all
changesets on all branches.
.sp
If \-r/\-\-rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors
will be pushed to the remote repository.

.fi
.sp
Merges with unresolved conflicts are often the result of
non\-interactive merging using the \fBinternal:merge\fP configuration
setting, or a command\-line merge tool like \fBdiff3\fP. The resolve
command is used to manage the files involved in a merge, after
\%\fBhg merge\fP\: has been run, and before \%\fBhg commit\fP\: is run (i.e. the
working directory must have two parents).
.sp
The resolve command can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve [\-\-tool TOOL] FILE...\fP\:: attempt to re\-merge the specified
files, discarding any previous merge attempts. Re\-merging is not
performed for files already marked as resolved. Use \fB\-\-all/\-a\fP
to select all unresolved files. \fB\-\-tool\fP can be used to specify
the merge tool used for the given files. It overrides the HGMERGE
environment variable and your configuration files.  Previous file
contents are saved with a \fB.orig\fP suffix.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve \-m [FILE]\fP\:: mark a file as having been resolved
(e.g. after having manually fixed\-up the files). The default is
to mark all unresolved files.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve \-u [FILE]...\fP\:: mark a file as unresolved. The
default is to mark all resolved files.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve \-l\fP\:: list files which had or still have conflicts.
In the printed list, \fBU\fP = unresolved and \fBR\fP = resolved.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that Mercurial will not let you commit files with unresolved

To check out earlier revisions, you should use \%\fBhg update REV\fP\:.
To cancel a merge (and lose your changes), use \%\fBhg update \-\-clean .\fP\:.
.RE
.sp
With no revision specified, revert the specified files or directories
to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.
This restores the contents of files to an unmodified
state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a
revision.
.sp
Using the \-r/\-\-rev or \-d/\-\-date options, revert the given files or
directories to their states as of a specific revision. Because
revert does not change the working directory parents, this will
cause these files to appear modified. This can be helpful to "back
out" some or all of an earlier change. See \%\fBhg backout\fP\: for a
related method.
.sp
Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.
To disable these backups, use \-\-no\-backup.

.SS rollback
.sp

.ft C
hg rollback
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter
the working directory.
.sp
Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a
repository. For example, the following commands are transactional,
and their effects can be rolled back:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
commit
.IP \(bu 2
.
import
.IP \(bu 2
.
pull
.IP \(bu 2
.
push (with this repository as the destination)
.IP \(bu 2
.
unbundle
.UNINDENT
.sp
It\(aqs possible to lose data with rollback: commit, update back to
an older changeset, and then rollback. The update removes the
changes you committed from the working directory, and rollback
removes them from history. To avoid data loss, you must pass
\-\-force in this case.
.sp
This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction
back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled
the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the
repository; for example an in\-progress pull from the repository
may fail if a rollback is performed.
.sp
Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

.sp
Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use
this for ad\-hoc sharing and browsing of repositories. It is
recommended to use a real web server to serve a repository for
longer periods of time.
.sp
Please note that the server does not implement access control.
This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and
nobody can write to it by default. Set the \fBweb.allow_push\fP
option to \fB*\fP to allow everybody to push to the server. You
should use a real web server if you need to authenticate users.
.sp
By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
stderr. Use the \-A/\-\-accesslog and \-E/\-\-errorlog options to log to
files.
.sp
To have the server choose a free port number to listen on, specify
a port number of 0; in this case, the server will print the port
number it uses.

the source of a copy/move operation, are not listed unless
\-c/\-\-clean, \-i/\-\-ignored, \-C/\-\-copies or \-A/\-\-all are given.

.
status may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have
changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does
not report permission changes and diff only reports changes
relative to one merge parent.

If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.
If two revisions are given, the differences between them are

.fi
.sp
Name a particular revision using <name>.
.sp
Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc. Changing
an existing tag is normally disallowed; use \-f/\-\-force to override.
.sp
If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
used, or tip if no revision is checked out.
.sp
To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed similarly
to other project files and can be hand\-edited if necessary. This
also means that tagging creates a new commit. The file
".hg/localtags" is used for local tags (not shared among
repositories).
.sp
Tag commits are usually made at the head of a branch. If the parent
of the working directory is not a branch head, \%\fBhg tag\fP\: aborts; use
\-f/\-\-force to force the tag commit to be based on a non\-head
changeset.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help dates\fP\: for a list of formats valid for \-d/\-\-date.

Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision
lookup, using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.

.sp
Update the repository\(aqs working directory to the specified

current named branch.
.sp
If the changeset is not a descendant of the working directory\(aqs
parent, the update is aborted. With the \-c/\-\-check option, the
working directory is checked for uncommitted changes; if none are
found, the working directory is updated to the specified
changeset.
.sp
Update sets the working directory\(aqs parent revison to the specified
changeset (see \%\fBhg help parents\fP\:).
.sp
The following rules apply when the working directory contains
uncommitted changes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
If neither \-c/\-\-check nor \-C/\-\-clean is specified, and if
the requested changeset is an ancestor or descendant of
the working directory\(aqs parent, the uncommitted changes
are merged into the requested changeset and the merged
result is left uncommitted. If the requested changeset is
not an ancestor or descendant (that is, it is on another
branch), the update is aborted and the uncommitted changes
are preserved.
.IP 2. 3
.
With the \-c/\-\-check option, the update is aborted and the
uncommitted changes are preserved.
.IP 3. 3

.IP \(bu 2
.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBWed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006\fP (local timezone assumed)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBDec 6 13:18 \-0600\fP (year assumed, time offset provided)
.IP \(bu 2

\fB12/6/6\fP (Dec 6 2006)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lastly, there is Mercurial\(aqs internal format:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB1165432709 0\fP (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the internal representation format for dates. The first number
is the number of seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01 00:00 UTC). The
second is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC
(negative if the timezone is east of UTC).
.sp
The log command also accepts date ranges:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB<DATE\fP \- at or before a given date/time
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB>DATE\fP \- on or after a given date/time
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBDATE to DATE\fP \- a date range, inclusive
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB\-DAYS\fP \- within a given number of days of today
.UNINDENT
.SH DIFF FORMATS
.sp
Mercurial\(aqs default format for showing changes between two versions of
a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be
used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.
.sp
While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the
following information:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
executable status and other permission bits
.IP \(bu 2
.
copy or rename information
.IP \(bu 2
.
changes in binary files
.IP \(bu 2
.
creation or deletion of empty files
.UNINDENT
.sp
Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced
by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this
format.
.sp
This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
(e.g. with \%\fBhg export\fP\:), you should be careful about things like file
copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when
applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra
information is lost. Mercurial\(aqs internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary
format for communicating changes.
.sp
To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the \-\-git
option available for many commands, or set \(aqgit = True\(aq in the [diff]
section of your configuration file. You do not need to set this option
when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B HG
.
Path to the \(aqhg\(aq executable, automatically passed when running
hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is
the hg executable\(aqs name if it\(aqs frozen, or an executable named
\(aqhg\(aq (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on
Windows) is searched.
.TP
.B HGEDITOR
.
This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.
.sp
(deprecated, use configuration file)
.TP
.B HGENCODING
.
This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
This setting is used to convert data including usernames,
changeset descriptions, tag names, and branches. This setting can
be overridden with the \-\-encoding command\-line option.
.TP
.B HGENCODINGMODE
.
This sets Mercurial\(aqs behavior for handling unknown characters
while transcoding user input. The default is "strict", which
causes Mercurial to abort if it can\(aqt map a character. Other
settings include "replace", which replaces unknown characters, and
"ignore", which drops them. This setting can be overridden with
the \-\-encodingmode command\-line option.
.TP
.B HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS
.
This sets Mercurial\(aqs behavior for handling characters with
"ambiguous" widths like accented Latin characters with East Asian
fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes ambiguous characters are
narrow, set this variable to "wide" if such characters cause
formatting problems.
.TP
.B HGMERGE
.
An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
ancestor file.
.sp
(deprecated, use configuration file)
.TP
.B HGRCPATH
.
A list of files or directories to search for configuration
files. Item separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows. If HGRCPATH
is not set, platform default search path is used. If empty, only
the .hg/hgrc from the current repository is read.
.sp
For each element in HGRCPATH:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
if it\(aqs a directory, all files ending with .rc are added
.IP \(bu 2
.
otherwise, the file itself will be added
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B HGPLAIN
.
When set, this disables any configuration settings that might
change Mercurial\(aqs default output. This includes encoding,
defaults, verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and
localization. This can be useful when scripting against Mercurial
in the face of existing user configuration.
.sp
Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment
variables are not overridden.
.TP
.B HGPLAINEXCEPT
.
This is a comma\-separated list of features to preserve when
HGPLAIN is enabled. Currently the only value supported is "i18n",
which preserves internationalization in plain mode.
.sp
Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything (even an empty string) will
enable plain mode.
.TP
.B HGUSER
.
This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not set,
available values will be considered in this order:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
HGUSER (deprecated)
.IP \(bu 2
.
configuration files from the HGRCPATH
.IP \(bu 2
.
EMAIL
.IP \(bu 2
.
interactive prompt
.IP \(bu 2
.
LOGNAME (with \fB@hostname\fP appended)
.UNINDENT
.sp
(deprecated, use configuration file)
.TP
.B EMAIL
.
May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.
.TP
.B LOGNAME
.
May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.
.TP
.B VISUAL
.
This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.
.TP
.B EDITOR
.
Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a
user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The
editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment
variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first
non\-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
defaults to \(aqvi\(aq.
.TP
.B PYTHONPATH
.
This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be
set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system\-wide.
.UNINDENT
.SH USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES
.sp
Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to
existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or
implement hooks.
.sp
Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:
they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced
usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such
as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready
for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock
Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as
needed.
.sp
To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in the
Python search path, create an entry for it in your configuration file,
like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
foo =
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You may also specify the full path to an extension:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To explicitly disable an extension enabled in a configuration file of
broader scope, prepend its path with !:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
# disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
# ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
baz = !

Like other file patterns, this pattern type is indicated by a prefix,
\(aqset:\(aq. The language supports a number of predicates which are joined
by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.
.sp
Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with single
or double quotes if they contain characters outside of
\fB[.*{}[]?/\e_a\-zA\-Z0\-9\ex80\-\exff]\fP or if they match one of the
predefined predicates. This generally applies to file patterns other
than globs and arguments for predicates.
.sp
Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
e.g., \fB\en\fP is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being
interpreted, strings can be prefixed with \fBr\fP, e.g. \fBr\(aq...\(aq\fP.
.sp
There is a single prefix operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBnot x\fP
.sp
Files not in x. Short form is \fB! x\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These are the supported infix operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBx and y\fP
.sp
The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is \fBx & y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx or y\fP
.sp
The union of files in x and y. There are two alternative short
forms: \fBx | y\fP and \fBx + y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx \- y\fP
.sp
Files in x but not in y.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following predicates are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBadded()\fP
.sp
File that is added according to status.

.SH GLOSSARY
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Ancestor
.
Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of parent
changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors
of a changeset can be defined by two properties: a parent of a
changeset is an ancestor, and a parent of an ancestor is an
ancestor. See also: \(aqDescendant\(aq.
.TP
.B Bookmark
.
Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when
committing. They are similar to tags in that it is possible to use
bookmark names in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset
ID, e.g., with \%\fBhg update\fP\:. Unlike tags, bookmarks move along
when you make a commit.
.sp
Bookmarks can be renamed, copied and deleted. Bookmarks are local,
unless they are explicitly pushed or pulled between repositories.
Pushing and pulling bookmarks allow you to collaborate with others
on a branch without creating a named branch.
.TP
.B Branch
.
(Noun) A child changeset that has been created from a parent that
is not a head. These are known as topological branches, see
\(aqBranch, topological\(aq. If a topological branch is named, it becomes
a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes
an anonymous branch. See \(aqBranch, anonymous\(aq and \(aqBranch, named\(aq.
.sp
Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or pushed to
a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these
operations. Note that the term branch can also be used informally
to describe a development process in which certain development is
done independently of other development. This is sometimes done
explicitly with a named branch, but it can also be done locally,
using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.
.sp
Example: "The experimental branch".
.sp
(Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which results in
its parent having more than one child.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm going to branch at X".
.TP
.B Branch, anonymous
.
Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is not
a head and the name of the branch is not changed, a new anonymous
branch is created.
.TP
.B Branch, closed
.
A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.
.TP
.B Branch, default
.
The branch assigned to a changeset when no name has previously been
assigned.
.TP
.B Branch head
.
See \(aqHead, branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Branch, inactive
.
If a named branch has no topological heads, it is considered to be
inactive. As an example, a feature branch becomes inactive when it
is merged into the default branch. The \%\fBhg branches\fP\: command
shows inactive branches by default, though they can be hidden with
\%\fBhg branches \-\-active\fP\:.
.sp
NOTE: this concept is deprecated because it is too implicit.
Branches should now be explicitly closed using \%\fBhg commit
\-\-close\-branch\fP\: when they are no longer needed.
.TP
.B Branch, named
.
A collection of changesets which have the same branch name. By
default, children of a changeset in a named branch belong to the
same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a
different branch. See \%\fBhg help branch\fP\:, \%\fBhg help branches\fP\: and
\%\fBhg commit \-\-close\-branch\fP\: for more information on managing
branches.
.sp
Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace, dividing
the collection of changesets that comprise the repository into a
collection of disjoint subsets. A named branch is not necessarily
a topological branch. If a new named branch is created from the
head of another named branch, or the default branch, but no
further changesets are added to that previous branch, then that
previous branch will be a branch in name only.
.TP
.B Branch tip
.
See \(aqTip, branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Branch, topological
.
Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is
not a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topological
branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a topological
branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch of the
current, possibly default, branch.
.TP
.B Changelog
.
A record of the changesets in the order in which they were added
to the repository. This includes details such as changeset id,
author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.
.TP
.B Changeset
.
A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a change.
.TP
.B Changeset, child
.
The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C is
a child of P. There is no limit to the number of children that a
changeset may have.
.TP
.B Changeset id
.
A SHA\-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be
represented as either a "long" 40 hexadecimal digit string, or a
"short" 12 hexadecimal digit string.
.TP
.B Changeset, merge
.
A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is
committed.
.TP
.B Changeset, parent
.
A revision upon which a child changeset is based. Specifically, a
parent changeset of a changeset C is a changeset whose node
immediately precedes C in the DAG. Changesets have at most two
parents.
.TP
.B Checkout
.
(Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific
revision. This use should probably be avoided where possible, as
changeset is much more appropriate than checkout in this context.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm using checkout X."
.sp
(Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific changeset. See
\%\fBhg help update\fP\:.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm going to check out changeset X."

.B Clone
.
(Noun) An entire or partial copy of a repository. The partial
clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.
.sp
Example: "Is your clone up to date?".
.sp
(Verb) The process of creating a clone, using \%\fBhg clone\fP\:.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm going to clone the repository".
.TP
.B Closed branch head
.
See \(aqHead, closed branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Commit
.
(Noun) A synonym for changeset.
.sp
Example: "Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?"
.sp
(Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When files
are committed in a working directory, Mercurial finds the
differences between the committed files and their parent
changeset, creating a new changeset in the repository.
.sp
Example: "You should commit those changes now."
.TP
.B Cset
.
A common abbreviation of the term changeset.
.TP
.B DAG
.
The repository of changesets of a distributed version control
system (DVCS) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG),
consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to
changesets and edges imply a parent \-> child relation. This graph
can be visualized by graphical tools such as \%\fBhg glog\fP\:
(graphlog). In Mercurial, the DAG is limited by the requirement
for children to have at most two parents.
.TP
.B Default branch
.
See \(aqBranch, default\(aq.
.TP
.B Descendant
.
Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child changesets
from a given changeset. More precisely, the descendants of a
changeset can be defined by two properties: the child of a
changeset is a descendant, and the child of a descendant is a
descendant. See also: \(aqAncestor\(aq.
.TP
.B Diff
.
(Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes of files
in two changesets or a changeset and the current working
directory. The difference is usually represented in a standard
form called a "diff" or "patch". The "git diff" format is used
when the changes include copies, renames, or changes to file
attributes, none of which can be represented/handled by classic
"diff" and "patch".
.sp
Example: "Did you see my correction in the diff?"
.sp
(Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a diff or
patch.
.sp
Example: "If you diff with changeset X, you will see what I mean."
.TP
.B Directory, working
.
The working directory represents the state of the files tracked by
Mercurial, that will be recorded in the next commit. The working
directory initially corresponds to the snapshot at an existing
changeset, known as the parent of the working directory. See
\(aqParent, working directory\(aq. The state may be modified by changes
to the files introduced manually or by a merge. The repository
metadata exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.
.TP
.B Graph
.
See DAG and \%\fBhg help graphlog\fP\:.
.TP
.B Head
.
The term \(aqhead\(aq may be used to refer to both a branch head or a
repository head, depending on the context. See \(aqHead, branch\(aq and
\(aqHead, repository\(aq for specific definitions.
.sp
Heads are where development generally takes place and are the
usual targets for update and merge operations.
.TP
.B Head, branch
.
A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.
.TP
.B Head, closed branch
.
A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting. The closed
head is no longer listed by \%\fBhg heads\fP\:. A branch is considered
closed when all its heads are closed and consequently is not
listed by \%\fBhg branches\fP\:.
.TP
.B Head, repository
.
A topological head which has not been closed.
.TP
.B Head, topological
.
A changeset with no children in the repository.
.TP
.B History, immutable
.
Once committed, changesets cannot be altered.  Extensions which
appear to change history actually create new changesets that
replace existing ones, and then destroy the old changesets. Doing
so in public repositories can result in old changesets being
reintroduced to the repository.
.TP
.B History, rewriting
.
The changesets in a repository are immutable. However, extensions
to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually in such
a way as to preserve changeset contents.
.TP
.B Immutable history
.
See \(aqHistory, immutable\(aq.
.TP
.B Merge changeset
.
See \(aqChangeset, merge\(aq.
.TP
.B Manifest
.
Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files that are
tracked by the changeset.
.TP
.B Merge
.
Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When you update
to a changeset and then merge another changeset, you bring the
history of the latter changeset into your working directory. Once
conflicts are resolved (and marked), this merge may be committed
as a merge changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.
.TP
.B Named branch
.
See \(aqBranch, named\(aq.
.TP
.B Null changeset
.
The empty changeset. It is the parent state of newly\-initialized
repositories and repositories with no checked out revision. It is
thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor when
merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias \(aqnull\(aq
or by the changeset ID \(aq000000000000\(aq.
.TP
.B Parent
.
See \(aqChangeset, parent\(aq.
.TP
.B Parent changeset
.
See \(aqChangeset, parent\(aq.
.TP
.B Parent, working directory
.
The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision which is
the child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncommitted
merge) shown by \%\fBhg parents\fP\:. This is changed with
\%\fBhg update\fP\:. Other commands to see the working directory parent
are \%\fBhg summary\fP\: and \%\fBhg id\fP\:. Can be specified by the alias ".".
.TP
.B Patch
.
(Noun) The product of a diff operation.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqve sent you my patch."
.sp
(Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one
changeset into another.
.sp
Example: "You will need to patch that revision."
.TP
.B Pull
.
An operation in which changesets in a remote repository which are
not in the local repository are brought into the local
repository. Note that this operation without special arguments
only updates the repository, it does not update the files in the
working directory. See \%\fBhg help pull\fP\:.
.TP
.B Push
.
An operation in which changesets in a local repository which are
not in a remote repository are sent to the remote repository. Note
that this operation only adds changesets which have been committed
locally to the remote repository. Uncommitted changes are not
sent. See \%\fBhg help push\fP\:.
.TP
.B Repository
.
The metadata describing all recorded states of a collection of
files. Each recorded state is represented by a changeset. A
repository is usually (but not always) found in the \fB.hg\fP
subdirectory of a working directory. Any recorded state can be
recreated by "updating" a working directory to a specific
changeset.
.TP
.B Repository head
.
See \(aqHead, repository\(aq.

A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier revisions
can be updated to by using \%\fBhg update\fP\:.  See also \(aqRevision
number\(aq; See also \(aqChangeset\(aq.
.TP
.B Revision number
.
This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific
repository. It represents the order in which changesets were added
to a repository, starting with revision number 0. Note that the
revision number may be different in each clone of a repository. To
identify changesets uniquely between different clones, see
\(aqChangeset id\(aq.
.TP

.
See \(aqHistory, rewriting\(aq.
.TP
.B Root
.
A changeset that has only the null changeset as its parent. Most
repositories have only a single root changeset.
.TP
.B Tag
.
An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can be used in all
places where Mercurial expects a changeset ID, e.g., with
\%\fBhg update\fP\:. The creation of a tag is stored in the history and
will thus automatically be shared with other using push and pull.
.TP
.B Tip
.
The changeset with the highest revision number. It is the changeset
most recently added in a repository.
.TP
.B Tip, branch
.
The head of a given branch with the highest revision number. When
a branch name is used as a revision identifier, it refers to the
branch tip. See also \(aqBranch, head\(aq. Note that because revision

.SH SYNTAX FOR MERCURIAL IGNORE FILES
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
The Mercurial system uses a file called \fB.hgignore\fP in the root
directory of a repository to control its behavior when it searches
for files that it is not currently tracking.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain
files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup
files created by editors and build products created by compilers.
These files can be ignored by listing them in a \fB.hgignore\fP file in
the root of the working directory. The \fB.hgignore\fP file must be
created manually. It is typically put under version control, so that
the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.
.sp
An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository
root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against
any pattern in \fB.hgignore\fP.
.sp
For example, say we have an untracked file, \fBfile.c\fP, at
\fBa/b/file.c\fP inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore \fBfile.c\fP
if any pattern in \fB.hgignore\fP matches \fBa/b/file.c\fP, \fBa/b\fP or \fBa\fP.
.sp
In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of
per\-user or global ignore files. See the \fBignore\fP configuration
key on the \fB[ui]\fP section of \%\fBhg help config\fP\: for details of how to
configure these files.
.sp
To control Mercurial\(aqs handling of files that it manages, many
commands support the \fB\-I\fP and \fB\-X\fP options; see
\%\fBhg help <command>\fP\: and \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for details.
.SH SYNTAX
.sp
An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns,
with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The \fB#\fP
character is treated as a comment character, and the \fB\e\fP character
is treated as an escape character.
.sp
Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax used
is Python/Perl\-style regular expressions.
.sp
To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
syntax: NAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \fBNAME\fP is one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBregexp\fP
.sp
Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.
.TP
.B \fBglob\fP
.sp
Shell\-style glob.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that
follow, until another syntax is selected.
.sp
Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob\-syntax pattern of
the form \fB*.c\fP will match a file ending in \fB.c\fP in any directory,
and a regexp pattern of the form \fB\e.c$\fP will do the same. To root a
regexp pattern, start it with \fB^\fP.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
Here is an example ignore file.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# use glob syntax.
syntax: glob

*.elc
*.pyc
*~

# switch to regexp syntax.
syntax: regexp
^\e.pc/
.ft P
.fi
.SH CONFIGURING HGWEB
.sp
Mercurial\(aqs internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single
repository, or a collection of them. In the latter case, a special
configuration file can be used to specify the repository paths to use
and global web configuration options.
.sp
This file uses the same syntax as other Mercurial configuration files,
but only the following sections are recognized:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
web
.IP \(bu 2
.
paths
.IP \(bu 2
.
collections
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBweb\fP section can specify all the settings described in the web
section of the hgrc(5) documentation. See \%\fBhg help config\fP\: for
information on where to find the manual page.
.sp
The \fBpaths\fP section provides mappings of physical repository
paths to virtual ones. For instance:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
projects/a = /foo/bar
projects/b = /baz/quux
web/root = /real/root/*
/ = /real/root2/*
virtual/root2 = /real/root2/**
.ft P
.fi
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
The first two entries make two repositories in different directories
appear under the same directory in the web interface
.IP \(bu 2
.
The third entry maps every Mercurial repository found in \(aq/real/root\(aq
into \(aqweb/root\(aq. This format is preferred over the [collections] one,
since using absolute paths as configuration keys is not supported on every
platform (especially on Windows).
.IP \(bu 2
.
The fourth entry is a special case mapping all repositories in
\(aq/real/root2\(aq in the root of the virtual directory.
.IP \(bu 2
.
The fifth entry recursively finds all repositories under the real
root, and maps their relative paths under the virtual root.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBcollections\fP section provides mappings of trees of physical
repositories paths to virtual ones, though the paths syntax is generally
preferred. For instance:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[collections]
/foo = /foo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Here, the left side will be stripped off all repositories found in the
right side. Thus \fB/foo/bar\fP and \fBfoo/quux/baz\fP will be listed as
\fBbar\fP and \fBquux/baz\fP respectively.
.SH MERGE TOOLS
.sp
To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.
.sp
A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a merged
file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common
ancestor of the two file versions, so they can determine the changes
made on both branches.
.sp
Merge tools are used both for \%\fBhg resolve\fP\:, \%\fBhg merge\fP\:, \%\fBhg update\fP\:,
\%\fBhg backout\fP\: and in several extensions.
.sp
Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the files by
combining all non\-overlapping changes that occurred separately in
the two different evolutions of the same initial base file. Furthermore, some
interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve
conflicting merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some
conflict markers. Mercurial does not include any interactive merge
programs but relies on external tools for that.
.SS Available merge tools
.sp
External merge tools and their properties are configured in the
merge\-tools configuration section \- see hgrc(5) \- but they can often just
be named by their executable.
.sp
A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found on the
system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if it
is an absolute or relative executable path or the name of an
application in the executable search path. The tool is assumed to be
able to handle the merge if it can handle symlinks if the file is a
symlink, if it can handle binary files if the file is binary, and if a
GUI is available if the tool requires a GUI.
.sp
There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal
merge tools are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBinternal:merge\fP
.sp
Uses the internal non\-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in
the partially merged file.
.TP
.B \fBinternal:fail\fP
.sp
Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both
branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must be
used to resolve these conflicts.
.TP
.B \fBinternal:local\fP
.sp
Uses the local version of files as the merged version.
.TP
.B \fBinternal:other\fP
.sp
Uses the other version of files as the merged version.
.TP
.B \fBinternal:prompt\fP
.sp
Asks the user which of the local or the other version to keep as
the merged version.
.TP
.B \fBinternal:dump\fP
.sp
Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the
contents of local, other and base. These files can then be used to
perform a merge manually. If the file to be merged is named
\fBa.txt\fP, these files will accordingly be named \fBa.txt.local\fP,
\fBa.txt.other\fP and \fBa.txt.base\fP and they will be placed in the
same directory as \fBa.txt\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Internal tools are always available and do not require a GUI but will by default
not handle symlinks or binary files.
.SS Choosing a merge tool
.sp
Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
If a tool has been specified with the \-\-tool option to merge or resolve, it
is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the merge\-tools configuration, its
configuration is used. Otherwise the specified tool must be executable by
the shell.
.IP 2. 3
.
If the \fBHGMERGE\fP environment variable is present, its value is used and
must be executable by the shell.
.IP 3. 3
.
If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the patterns in the
merge\-patterns configuration section, the first usable merge tool
corresponding to a matching pattern is used. Here, binary capabilities of the
merge tool are not considered.
.IP 4. 3
.
If ui.merge is set it will be considered next. If the value is not the name
of a configured tool, the specified value is used and must be executable by
the shell. Otherwise the named tool is used if it is usable.
.IP 5. 3
.
If any usable merge tools are present in the merge\-tools configuration
section, the one with the highest priority is used.
.IP 6. 3
.
If a program named \fBhgmerge\fP can be found on the system, it is used \- but
it will by default not be used for symlinks and binary files.
.IP 7. 3
.
If the file to be merged is not binary and is not a symlink, then
\fBinternal:merge\fP is used.
.IP 8. 3
.
The merge of the file fails and must be resolved before commit.
.UNINDENT
.IP Note
.
After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default attempt
to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first. Only if it doesn\(aqt
succeed because of conflicting changes Mercurial will actually execute the
merge program. Whether to use the simple merge algorithm first can be
controlled by the premerge setting of the merge tool. Premerge is enabled by
default unless the file is binary or a symlink.
.RE
.sp
See the merge\-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the
configuration of merge tools.
.SH SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS
.sp
When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be specified
individually, or provided as a topologically continuous range,
separated by the ":" character.
.sp
The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END are
revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not
specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END is not specified,
it defaults to the tip. The range ":" thus means "all revisions".
.sp
If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order.
.sp
A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5
gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.
.SH FILE NAME PATTERNS
.sp
Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files
at a time.
.sp
By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell\-style extended glob
patterns.
.sp
Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.
.sp
To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it with
\fBpath:\fP. These path names must completely match starting at the
current repository root.
.sp
To use an extended glob, start a name with \fBglob:\fP. Globs are rooted
at the current directory; a glob such as \fB*.c\fP will only match files
in the current directory ending with \fB.c\fP.
.sp
The supported glob syntax extensions are \fB**\fP to match any string
across path separators and \fB{a,b}\fP to mean "a or b".
.sp
To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with \fBre:\fP.
Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.
.sp
To read name patterns from a file, use \fBlistfile:\fP or \fBlistfile0:\fP.
The latter expects null delimited patterns while the former expects line
feeds. Each string read from the file is itself treated as a file
pattern.
.sp
Plain examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
               of the repository
path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Glob examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
*.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
**.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
               current directory including itself.
foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
               including itself.
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Regexp examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
re:.*\e.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository
.ft P
.fi
.sp
File examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
listfile:list.txt  read list from list.txt with one file pattern per line
listfile0:list.txt read list from list.txt with null byte delimiters
.ft P
.fi
.sp
See also \%\fBhg help filesets\fP\:.
.SH SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS
.sp
Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.
.sp
A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with \-1 denoting the tip,
\-2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.
.sp
A 40\-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
identifier.
.sp
A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short\-form
identifier. A short\-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix
of exactly one full\-length identifier.
.sp
Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A tag name is a
symbolic name associated with a revision identifier. A branch name
denotes the tipmost revision of that branch. Tag and branch names must
not contain the ":" character.
.sp
The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies the
most recent revision.
.sp
The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.
.sp
The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If no
working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an
uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first
parent.
.SH SPECIFYING REVISION SETS
.sp
Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
revisions.
.sp
The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by infix
operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.
.sp
Identifiers such as branch names must be quoted with single or double
quotes if they contain characters outside of
\fB[._a\-zA\-Z0\-9\ex80\-\exff]\fP or if they match one of the predefined
predicates.
.sp
Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
e.g., \fB\en\fP is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being
interpreted, strings can be prefixed with \fBr\fP, e.g. \fBr\(aq...\(aq\fP.
.sp
There is a single prefix operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBnot x\fP
.sp
Changesets not in x. Short form is \fB! x\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These are the supported infix operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBx::y\fP
.sp
A DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants of x and
ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If the first endpoint
is left out, this is equivalent to \fBancestors(y)\fP, if the second
is left out it is equivalent to \fBdescendants(x)\fP.
.sp
An alternative syntax is \fBx..y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx:y\fP
.sp
All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both
inclusive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default to 0 and
tip.
.TP
.B \fBx and y\fP
.sp
The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is \fBx & y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx or y\fP
.sp
The union of changesets in x and y. There are two alternative short
forms: \fBx | y\fP and \fBx + y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx \- y\fP
.sp
Changesets in x but not in y.
.TP
.B \fBx^n\fP
.sp
The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2.
For n == 0, x; for n == 1, the first parent of each changeset in x;
for n == 2, the second parent of changeset in x.
.TP
.B \fBx~n\fP
.sp
The nth first ancestor of x; \fBx~0\fP is x; \fBx~3\fP is \fBx^^^\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
There is a single postfix operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBx^\fP
.sp
Equivalent to \fBx^1\fP, the first parent of each changeset in x.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following predicates are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBadds(pattern)\fP
.sp
Changesets that add a file matching pattern.
.TP
.B \fBall()\fP
.sp
All changesets, the same as \fB0:tip\fP.
.TP
.B \fBancestor(single, single)\fP
.sp
Greatest common ancestor of the two changesets.

.SH SUBREPOSITORIES
.sp
Subrepositories let you nest external repositories or projects into a
parent Mercurial repository, and make commands operate on them as a
group.
.sp
Mercurial currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion
subrepositories.
.sp
Subrepositories are made of three components:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Nested repository checkouts. They can appear anywhere in the
parent working directory.
.IP 2. 3
.
Nested repository references. They are defined in \fB.hgsub\fP and
tell where the subrepository checkouts come from. Mercurial
subrepositories are referenced like:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
path/to/nested = \%https://example.com/nested/repo/path\:
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
path/to/nested = [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBpath/to/nested\fP is the checkout location relatively to the
parent Mercurial root, and \fBhttps://example.com/nested/repo/path\fP
is the source repository path. The source can also reference a
filesystem path.
.sp
Note that \fB.hgsub\fP does not exist by default in Mercurial
repositories, you have to create and add it to the parent
repository before using subrepositories.
.IP 3. 3
.
Nested repository states. They are defined in \fB.hgsubstate\fP and
capture whatever information is required to restore the
subrepositories to the state they were committed in a parent
repository changeset. Mercurial automatically record the nested
repositories states when committing in the parent repository.
.IP Note
.
The \fB.hgsubstate\fP file should not be edited manually.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.SH ADDING A SUBREPOSITORY
.sp
If \fB.hgsub\fP does not exist, create it and add it to the parent
repository. Clone or checkout the external projects where you want it
to live in the parent repository. Edit \fB.hgsub\fP and add the
subrepository entry as described above. At this point, the
subrepository is tracked and the next commit will record its state in
\fB.hgsubstate\fP and bind it to the committed changeset.
.SH SYNCHRONIZING A SUBREPOSITORY
.sp
Subrepos do not automatically track the latest changeset of their
sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that corresponds
with the changeset checked out in the top\-level changeset. This is so
developers always get a consistent set of compatible code and
libraries when they update.
.sp
Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply check out target
subrepo at the desired revision, test in the top\-level repo, then
commit in the parent repository to record the new combination.
.SH DELETING A SUBREPOSITORY
.sp
To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete its
reference from \fB.hgsub\fP, then remove its files.
.SH INTERACTION WITH MERCURIAL COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B add
.
add does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos is
specified. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B archive
.
archive does not recurse in subrepositories unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified.
.TP
.B commit
.
commit creates a consistent snapshot of the state of the
entire project and its subrepositories. It does this by first
attempting to commit all modified subrepositories, then recording
their state and finally committing it in the parent
repository. Mercurial can be made to abort if any subrepository
content is modified by setting "ui.commitsubrepos=no" in a
configuration file (see \%\fBhg help config\fP\:).
.TP
.B diff
.
diff does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos is
specified. Changes are displayed as usual, on the subrepositories
elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B incoming
.
incoming does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos
is specified. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B outgoing
.
outgoing does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos
is specified. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B pull
.
pull is not recursive since it is not clear what to pull prior
to running \%\fBhg update\fP\:. Listing and retrieving all
subrepositories changes referenced by the parent repository pulled
changesets is expensive at best, impossible in the Subversion
case.
.TP
.B push
.
Mercurial will automatically push all subrepositories first
when the parent repository is being pushed. This ensures new
subrepository changes are available when referenced by top\-level
repositories.
.TP
.B status
.
status does not recurse into subrepositories unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified. Subrepository changes are displayed as
regular Mercurial changes on the subrepository
elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B update
.
update restores the subrepos in the state they were
originally committed in target changeset. If the recorded
changeset is not available in the current subrepository, Mercurial
will pull it in first before updating.  This means that updating
can require network access when using subrepositories.
.UNINDENT
.SH REMAPPING SUBREPOSITORIES SOURCES
.sp
A subrepository source location may change during a project life,
invalidating references stored in the parent repository history. To
fix this, rewriting rules can be defined in parent repository \fBhgrc\fP
file or in Mercurial configuration. See the \fB[subpaths]\fP section in
hgrc(5) for more details.
.SH TEMPLATE USAGE
.sp
Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
templates. You can either pass in a template from the command
line, via the \-\-template option, or select an existing
template\-style (\-\-style).
.sp
You can customize output for any "log\-like" command: log,
outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, heads and glog.
.sp
Four styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the style used
when no explicit preference is passed), compact, changelog,
and xml.
Usage:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r1 \-\-style changelog
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable
expansion:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r1 \-\-template "{node}\en"
b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of
keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These
keywords are usually available for templating a log\-like command:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B author
.
String. The unmodified author of the changeset.

The "date" keyword does not produce human\-readable output. If you
want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process
it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input

applying a string\-input filter to a list\-like input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output:

.UNINDENT
.SH URL PATHS
.sp
Valid URLs are of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
local/filesystem/path[#revision]
file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by \%\fBhg bundle\fP\: or :hg:\(ga
incoming \-\-bundle\(ga). See also \%\fBhg help paths\fP\:.
.sp
An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
changeset to use from the remote repository. See also \%\fBhg help
revisions\fP\:.
.sp
Some features, such as pushing to \%http://\: and \%https://\: URLs are only
possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote Mercurial
server.
.sp
Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper configuration of
web.cacerts.
.sp
Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
.IP \(bu 2
.
path is relative to the remote user\(aqs home directory by default. Use
an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
Mercurial doesn\(aqt use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
  Compression no
Host *
  Compression yes
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Alternatively specify "ssh \-C" as your ssh command in your
configuration file or with the \-\-ssh command line option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These URLs can all be stored in your configuration file with path
aliases under the [paths] section like so:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
alias1 = URL1
alias2 = URL2
\&...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for
example \%\fBhg pull alias1\fP\: will be treated as \%\fBhg pull URL1\fP\:).
.sp
Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when
you do not provide the URL to a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B default:
.
When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
the location of the source repository as the new repository\(aqs
\(aqdefault\(aq path. This is then used when you omit path from push\- and
pull\-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).
.TP
.B default\-push:
.
The push command will look for a path named \(aqdefault\-push\(aq, and
prefer it over \(aqdefault\(aq if both are defined.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXTENSIONS
.sp
This section contains help for extensions that are distributed together with Mercurial. Help for other extensions is available in the help system.
.SS acl
.sp
hooks for controlling repository access
.sp
This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to given
branches and paths of a repository when receiving incoming changesets
via pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.
.sp
The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the
system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original
changeset (since the latter is merely informative).
.sp
The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh,
preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than pushing
or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have interactive
shell access, as they can then disable the hook. Nor is it safe if
remote users share an account, because then there is no way to
distinguish them.
.sp
The order in which access checks are performed is:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Deny  list for branches (section \fBacl.deny.branches\fP)
.IP 2. 3
.
Allow list for branches (section \fBacl.allow.branches\fP)
.IP 3. 3
.
Deny  list for paths    (section \fBacl.deny\fP)
.IP 4. 3
.
Allow list for paths    (section \fBacl.allow\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The allow and deny sections take key\-value pairs.
.SS Branch\-based Access Control
.sp
Use the \fBacl.deny.branches\fP and \fBacl.allow.branches\fP sections to
have branch\-based access control. Keys in these sections can be
either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
a branch name, or
.IP \(bu 2
.
an asterisk, to match any branch;
.UNINDENT
.sp
The corresponding values can be either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
a comma\-separated list containing users and groups, or
.IP \(bu 2
.
an asterisk, to match anyone;
.UNINDENT
.SS Path\-based Access Control
.sp
Use the \fBacl.deny\fP and \fBacl.allow\fP sections to have path\-based
access control. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with
a glob syntax by default). The corresponding values follow the same
syntax as the other sections above.
.SS Groups
.sp
Group names must be prefixed with an \fB@\fP symbol. Specifying a group
name has the same effect as specifying all the users in that group.
.sp
You can define group members in the \fBacl.groups\fP section.
If a group name is not defined there, and Mercurial is running under
a Unix\-like system, the list of users will be taken from the OS.
Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

.SS bugzilla
.sp
hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker
.sp
This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets
that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The comment is formatted using
the Mercurial template mechanism.
.sp
The hook does not change bug status.
.sp
Three basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Access via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.
.IP 2. 3
.
Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit bug change
via email to Bugzilla email interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.
.IP 3. 3
.
Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only Bugzilla installations
using MySQL are supported. Requires Python MySQLdb.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Writing directly to the database is susceptible to schema changes, and
relies on a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug change
notification emails. This script runs as the user running Mercurial,
must be run on the host with the Bugzilla install, and requires
permission to read Bugzilla configuration details and the necessary
MySQL user and password to have full access rights to the Bugzilla
database. For these reasons this access mode is now considered
deprecated, and will not be updated for new Bugzilla versions going
forward.
.sp
Access via XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be specified
in the configuration. Comments are added under that username. Since the
configuration must be readable by all Mercurial users, it is recommended
that the rights of that user are restricted in Bugzilla to the minimum
necessary to add comments.
.sp
Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends
email to the Bugzilla email interface to submit comments to bugs.
The From: address in the email is set to the email address of the Mercurial
user, so the comment appears to come from the Mercurial user. In the event
that the Mercurial user email is not recognised by Bugzilla as a Bugzilla
user, the email associated with the Bugzilla username used to log into
Bugzilla is used instead as the source of the comment.
.sp
Configuration items common to all access modes:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B bugzilla.version
.
This access type to use. Values recognised are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBxmlrpc\fP
.sp

.TP
.B \fBxmlrpc+email\fP
.sp
Bugzilla XMLRPC and email interfaces.
.TP
.B \fB3.0\fP
.sp
MySQL access, Bugzilla 3.0 and later.
.TP
.B \fB2.18\fP
.sp
MySQL access, Bugzilla 2.18 and up to but not
including 3.0.
.TP
.B \fB2.16\fP
.sp
MySQL access, Bugzilla 2.16 and up to but not
including 2.18.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B bugzilla.regexp
.
Regular expression to match bug IDs in changeset commit message.
Must contain one "()" group. The default expression matches \fBBug
1234\fP, \fBBug no. 1234\fP, \fBBug number 1234\fP, \fBBugs 1234,5678\fP,
\fBBug 1234 and 5678\fP and variations thereof. Matching is case
insensitive.
.TP
.B bugzilla.style
.
The style file to use when formatting comments.
.TP
.B bugzilla.template
.
Template to use when formatting comments. Overrides style if
specified. In addition to the usual Mercurial keywords, the
extension specifies:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP

{bug}.\endetails:\en\et{desc|tabindent}\fP
.TP
.B bugzilla.strip
.
The number of path separator characters to strip from the front of
the Mercurial repository path (\fB{root}\fP in templates) to produce
\fB{webroot}\fP. For example, a repository with \fB{root}\fP
\fB/var/local/my\-project\fP with a strip of 2 gives a value for
\fB{webroot}\fP of \fBmy\-project\fP. Default 0.
.TP
.B web.baseurl
.
Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories. Referenced from
templates as \fB{hgweb}\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Configuration items common to XMLRPC+email and MySQL access modes:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B bugzilla.usermap
.
Path of file containing Mercurial committer email to Bugzilla user email
mappings. If specified, the file should contain one mapping per
line:

.SS color
.sp

The available effects in terminfo mode are \(aqblink\(aq, \(aqbold\(aq, \(aqdim\(aq,
\(aqinverse\(aq, \(aqinvisible\(aq, \(aqitalic\(aq, \(aqstandout\(aq, and \(aqunderline\(aq; in
ECMA\-48 mode, the options are \(aqbold\(aq, \(aqinverse\(aq, \(aqitalic\(aq, and
\(aqunderline\(aq.  How each is rendered depends on the terminal emulator.
Some may not be available for a given terminal type, and will be
silently ignored.
.sp
Note that on some systems, terminfo mode may cause problems when using
color with the pager extension and less \-R. less with the \-R option
will only display ECMA\-48 color codes, and terminfo mode may sometimes
emit codes that less doesn\(aqt understand. You can work around this by
either using ansi mode (or auto mode), or by using less \-r (which will
pass through all terminal control codes, not just color control
codes).
.sp
Because there are only eight standard colors, this module allows you
to define color names for other color slots which might be available
for your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode.  For instance:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
color.brightblue = 12
color.pink = 207
color.orange = 202
.ft P
.fi
.sp
to set \(aqbrightblue\(aq to color slot 12 (useful for 16 color terminals
that have brighter colors defined in the upper eight) and, \(aqpink\(aq and
\(aqorange\(aq to colors in 256\-color xterm\(aqs default color cube.  These
defined colors may then be used as any of the pre\-defined eight,
including appending \(aq_background\(aq to set the background to that color.
.sp
By default, the color extension will use ANSI mode (or win32 mode on
Windows) if it detects a terminal. To override auto mode (to enable
terminfo mode, for example), set the following configuration option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[color]
mode = terminfo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Any value other than \(aqansi\(aq, \(aqwin32\(aq, \(aqterminfo\(aq, or \(aqauto\(aq will
disable color.

If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted.
Otherwise, convert will only import up to the named revision
(given in a format understood by the source).
.sp
If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source with \fB\-hg\fP appended. If the destination
repository doesn\(aqt exist, it will be created.
.sp
By default, all sources except Mercurial will use \-\-branchsort.
Mercurial uses \-\-sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers
order. Sort modes have the following effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-branchsort
.
convert from parent to child revision when possible,
which means branches are usually converted one after

.sp
If \fBREVMAP\fP isn\(aqt given, it will be put in a default location
(\fB<dest>/.hg/shamap\fP by default). The \fBREVMAP\fP is a simple
text file that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID
for that revision, like so:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<source ID> <destination ID>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If the file doesn\(aqt exist, it\(aqs automatically created. It\(aqs
updated on each commit copied, so \%\fBhg convert\fP\: can be interrupted
and can be run repeatedly to copy new commits.
.sp
The authormap is a simple text file that maps each source commit
author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source SCMs
that use unix logins to identify authors (eg: CVS). One line per
author mapping and the line format is:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
source author = destination author
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Empty lines and lines starting with a \fB#\fP are ignored.
.sp
The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files
and directories. Each line can contain one of the following
directives:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include path/to/file\-or\-dir

exclude path/to/file\-or\-dir

rename path/to/source path/to/destination
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Comment lines start with \fB#\fP. A specified path matches if it
equals the full relative name of a file or one of its parent
directories. The \fBinclude\fP or \fBexclude\fP directive with the
longest matching path applies, so line order does not matter.
.sp
The \fBinclude\fP directive causes a file, or all files under a
directory, to be included in the destination repository, and the
exclusion of all other files and directories not explicitly
included. The \fBexclude\fP directive causes files or directories to
be omitted. The \fBrename\fP directive renames a file or directory if
it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the root of
the repository, use \fB.\fP as the path to rename to.
.sp
The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic
history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is
useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or
graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry
contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two
comma\-separated values:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
key parent1, parent2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The key is the revision ID in the source
revision control system whose parents should be modified (same
format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs
(in either the source or destination revision control system) that
should be used as the new parents for that node. For example, if
you have merged "release\-1.0" into "trunk", then you should
specify the revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the one on
the "release\-1.0" branch as the second.
.sp
The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is
being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in
conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination
to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them
into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains
lines of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
original_branch_name new_branch_name
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where "original_branch_name" is the name of the branch in the
source repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the branch
is the destination repository. No whitespace is allowed in the
branch names. This can be used to (for instance) move code in one
repository from "default" to a named branch.
.SS Mercurial Source
.sp
The Mercurial source recognizes the following configuration
options, which you can set on the command line with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.hg.ignoreerrors
.
ignore integrity errors when reading.
Use it to fix Mercurial repositories with missing revlogs, by
converting from and to Mercurial. Default is False.
.TP
.B convert.hg.saverev
.
store original revision ID in changeset
(forces target IDs to change). It takes a boolean argument and
defaults to False.
.TP
.B convert.hg.startrev
.

It takes a hg revision identifier and defaults to 0.
.UNINDENT
.SS CVS Source
.sp
CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked\-out copy) from CVS
to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct
access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the
repository is \fB:local:\fP. The conversion uses the top level
directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses
CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless
a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be
converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS
sandbox is ignored.
.sp
The following options can be used with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.cache

Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is
allowed between commits with identical user and log message in
a single changeset. When very large files were checked in as
part of a changeset then the default may not be long enough.
The default is 60.
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.mergeto
.
Specify a regular expression to which
commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
conversion process will insert a dummy revision merging the
branch on which this log message occurs to the branch
indicated in the regex. Default is \fB{{mergetobranch
([\-\ew]+)}}\fP
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.mergefrom
.
Specify a regular expression to which
commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
conversion process will add the most recent revision on the
branch indicated in the regex as the second parent of the
changeset. Default is \fB{{mergefrombranch ([\-\ew]+)}}\fP
.TP
.B hook.cvslog
.
Specify a Python function to be called at the end of
gathering the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the
log entries, and can modify the entries in\-place, or add or
delete them.
.TP
.B hook.cvschangesets
.
Specify a Python function to be called after
the changesets are calculated from the the CVS log. The
function is passed a list with the changeset entries, and can
modify the changesets in\-place, or add or delete them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin
changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its
parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see
the command help for more details.
.SS Subversion Source
.sp
Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.
By default, the supplied \fBsvn://repo/path/\fP source URL is
converted as a single branch. If \fBsvn://repo/path/trunk\fP exists
it replaces the default branch. If \fBsvn://repo/path/branches\fP
exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If
\fBsvn://repo/path/tags\fP exists, it is looked for tags referencing
converted branches. Default \fBtrunk\fP, \fBbranches\fP and \fBtags\fP
values can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths
relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto
detection.
.sp
The following options can be set with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.svn.branches

.SS eol
.sp
automatically manage newlines in repository files
.sp
This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings (CRLF or
LF) that are used in the repository and in the local working
directory. That way you can get CRLF line endings on Windows and LF on
Unix/Mac, thereby letting everybody use their OS native line endings.
.sp
The extension reads its configuration from a versioned \fB.hgeol\fP
configuration file found in the root of the working copy. The
\fB.hgeol\fP file use the same syntax as all other Mercurial
configuration files. It uses two sections, \fB[patterns]\fP and
\fB[repository]\fP.
.sp
The \fB[patterns]\fP section specifies how line endings should be
converted between the working copy and the repository. The format is
specified by a file pattern. The first match is used, so put more
specific patterns first. The available line endings are \fBLF\fP,
\fBCRLF\fP, and \fBBIN\fP.
.sp
Files with the declared format of \fBCRLF\fP or \fBLF\fP are always
checked out and stored in the repository in that format and files
declared to be binary (\fBBIN\fP) are left unchanged. Additionally,
\fBnative\fP is an alias for checking out in the platform\(aqs default line
ending: \fBLF\fP on Unix (including Mac OS X) and \fBCRLF\fP on
Windows. Note that \fBBIN\fP (do nothing to line endings) is Mercurial\(aqs
default behaviour; it is only needed if you need to override a later,
more general pattern.
.sp
The optional \fB[repository]\fP section specifies the line endings to
use for files stored in the repository. It has a single setting,
\fBnative\fP, which determines the storage line endings for files
declared as \fBnative\fP in the \fB[patterns]\fP section. It can be set to
\fBLF\fP or \fBCRLF\fP. The default is \fBLF\fP. For example, this means
that on Windows, files configured as \fBnative\fP (\fBCRLF\fP by default)
will be converted to \fBLF\fP when stored in the repository. Files
declared as \fBLF\fP, \fBCRLF\fP, or \fBBIN\fP in the \fB[patterns]\fP section
are always stored as\-is in the repository.
.sp
Example versioned \fB.hgeol\fP file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[patterns]
**.py = native
**.vcproj = CRLF
**.txt = native
Makefile = LF
**.jpg = BIN

[repository]
native = LF
.ft P

.IP Note
.
The rules will first apply when files are touched in the working
copy, e.g. by updating to null and back to tip to touch all files.
.RE
.sp
The extension uses an optional \fB[eol]\fP section read from both the
normal Mercurial configuration files and the \fB.hgeol\fP file, with the
latter overriding the former. You can use that section to control the
overall behavior. There are three settings:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBeol.native\fP (default \fBos.linesep\fP) can be set to \fBLF\fP or
\fBCRLF\fP to override the default interpretation of \fBnative\fP for
checkout. This can be used with \%\fBhg archive\fP\: on Unix, say, to
generate an archive where files have line endings for Windows.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBeol.only\-consistent\fP (default True) can be set to False to make
the extension convert files with inconsistent EOLs. Inconsistent
means that there is both \fBCRLF\fP and \fBLF\fP present in the file.
Such files are normally not touched under the assumption that they
have mixed EOLs on purpose.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBeol.fix\-trailing\-newline\fP (default False) can be set to True to
ensure that converted files end with a EOL character (either \fB\en\fP
or \fB\er\en\fP as per the configured patterns).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The extension provides \fBcleverencode:\fP and \fBcleverdecode:\fP filters
like the deprecated win32text extension does. This means that you can
disable win32text and enable eol and your filters will still work. You
only need to these filters until you have prepared a \fB.hgeol\fP file.
.sp
The \fBwin32text.forbid*\fP hooks provided by the win32text extension
have been unified into a single hook named \fBeol.checkheadshook\fP. The
hook will lookup the expected line endings from the \fB.hgeol\fP file,
which means you must migrate to a \fB.hgeol\fP file first before using
the hook. \fBeol.checkheadshook\fP only checks heads, intermediate
invalid revisions will be pushed. To forbid them completely, use the
\fBeol.checkallhook\fP hook. These hooks are best used as
\fBpretxnchangegroup\fP hooks.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for more information about the glob patterns
used.
.SS extdiff
.sp
command to allow external programs to compare revisions
.sp
The extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs
to compare revisions, or revision with working directory. The external
diff programs are called with a configurable set of options and two
non\-option arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of
files to compare.
.sp
The extdiff extension also allows you to configure new diff commands, so
you do not need to type \%\fBhg extdiff \-p kdiff3\fP\: always.

.SS hgk
.sp
browse the repository in a graphical way
.sp
The hgk extension allows browsing the history of a repository in a
graphical way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk is not
distributed with Mercurial.)
.sp
hgk consists of two parts: a Tcl script that does the displaying and
querying of information, and an extension to Mercurial named hgk.py,
which provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can be found in
the contrib directory, and the extension is shipped in the hgext
repository, and needs to be enabled.
.sp
The \%\fBhg view\fP\: command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this command
to work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately, you can specify
the path to hgk in your configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[hgk]
path=/location/of/hgk
.ft P
.fi
.sp
hgk can make use of the extdiff extension to visualize revisions.
Assuming you had already configured extdiff vdiff command, just add:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[hgk]
vdiff=vdiff
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Revisions context menu will now display additional entries to fire
vdiff on hovered and selected revisions.

.SS keyword
.sp
expand keywords in tracked files
.sp
This extension expands RCS/CVS\-like or self\-customized $Keywords$ in
tracked text files selected by your configuration.
.sp
Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not stored in the
change history. The mechanism can be regarded as a convenience for the
current user or for archive distribution.
.sp
Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining to the latest change
relative to the working directory parent of each file.
.sp
Configuration is done in the [keyword], [keywordset] and [keywordmaps]
sections of hgrc files.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[keyword]
# expand keywords in every python file except those matching "x*"
**.py =
x*    = ignore

[keywordset]
# prefer svn\- over cvs\-like default keywordmaps
svn = True
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
.
The more specific you are in your filename patterns the less you
lose speed in huge repositories.
.RE
.sp
For [keywordmaps] template mapping and expansion demonstration and

.SS largefiles
.sp
track large binary files
.sp
Large binary files tend to be not very compressible, not very
diffable, and not at all mergeable. Such files are not handled
efficiently by Mercurial\(aqs storage format (revlog), which is based on
compressed binary deltas; storing large binary files as regular
Mercurial files wastes bandwidth and disk space and increases
Mercurial\(aqs memory usage. The largefiles extension addresses these
problems by adding a centralized client\-server layer on top of
Mercurial: largefiles live in a \fIcentral store\fP out on the network
somewhere, and you only fetch the revisions that you need when you
need them.
.sp
largefiles works by maintaining a "standin file" in .hglf/ for each
largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA\-1 hash plus
newline) and are tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions are
identified by the SHA\-1 hash of their contents, which is written to
the standin. largefiles uses that revision ID to get/put largefile
revisions from/to the central store. This saves both disk space and
bandwidth, since you don\(aqt need to retrieve all historical revisions
of large files when you clone or pull.
.sp
To start a new repository or add new large binary files, just add
\-\-large to your \%\fBhg add\fP\: command. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
$ hg add \-\-large randomdata
$ hg commit \-m \(aqadd randomdata as a largefile\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When you push a changeset that adds/modifies largefiles to a remote
repository, its largefile revisions will be uploaded along with it.
Note that the remote Mercurial must also have the largefiles extension
enabled for this to work.
.sp
When you pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote
repository, Mercurial behaves as normal. However, when you update to
such a revision, any largefiles needed by that revision are downloaded
and cached (if they have never been downloaded before). This means
that network access may be required to update to changesets you have
not previously updated to.
.sp
If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without the
largefiles extension, you will need to convert your repository in
order to benefit from largefiles. This is done with the
\%\fBhg lfconvert\fP\: command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg lfconvert \-\-size 10 oldrepo newrepo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new file
over 10MB will automatically be added as a largefile. To change this
threshold, set \fBlargefiles.minsize\fP in your Mercurial config file
to the minimum size in megabytes to track as a largefile, or use the
\-\-lfsize option to the add command (also in megabytes):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[largefiles]
minsize = 2

$ hg add \-\-lfsize 2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \fBlargefiles.patterns\fP config option allows you to specify a list
of filename patterns (see \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\:) that should always be
tracked as largefiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[largefiles]
patterns =
  *.jpg
  re:.*\e.(png|bmp)$
  library.zip
  content/audio/*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Files that match one of these patterns will be added as largefiles
regardless of their size.
.SS Commands
.SS lfconvert
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg lfconvert SOURCE DEST [FILE ...]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Convert repository SOURCE to a new repository DEST, identical to
SOURCE except that certain files will be converted as largefiles:
specifically, any file that matches any PATTERN \fIor\fP whose size is
above the minimum size threshold is converted as a largefile. The
size used to determine whether or not to track a file as a
largefile is the size of the first version of the file. The
minimum size can be specified either with \-\-size or in
configuration as \fBlargefiles.size\fP.
.sp
After running this command you will need to make sure that
largefiles is enabled anywhere you intend to push the new
repository.
.sp
Use \-\-to\-normal to convert largefiles back to normal files; after
this, the DEST repository can be used without largefiles at all.

.SS mq
.sp
manage a stack of patches
.sp
This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
repository. It manages two stacks of patches \- all known patches, and
applied patches (subset of known patches).
.sp
Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches
directory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.
.sp
Common tasks (use \%\fBhg help command\fP\: for more details):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
create new patch                          qnew
import existing patch                     qimport

print patch series                        qseries
print applied patches                     qapplied

add known patch to applied stack          qpush
remove patch from applied stack           qpop
refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, mq will automatically use git patches when required to
avoid losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or empty
files creations or deletions. This behaviour can be configured with:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[mq]
git = auto/keep/yes/no
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If set to \(aqkeep\(aq, mq will obey the [diff] section configuration while
preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to \(aqyes\(aq or
\(aqno\(aq, mq will override the [diff] section and always generate git or
regular patches, possibly losing data in the second case.
.sp
You will by default be managing a patch queue named "patches". You can
create other, independent patch queues with the \%\fBhg qqueue\fP\: command.

.sp
qnew creates a new patch on top of the currently\-applied patch (if
any). The patch will be initialized with any outstanding changes
in the working directory. You may also use \-I/\-\-include,
\-X/\-\-exclude, and/or a list of files after the patch name to add
only changes to matching files to the new patch, leaving the rest
as uncommitted modifications.
.sp
\-u/\-\-user and \-d/\-\-date can be used to set the (given) user and
date, respectively. \-U/\-\-currentuser and \-D/\-\-currentdate set user
to current user and date to current date.

hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Use the \%\fBhg qguard\fP\: command to set or print guards on patch, then use
qselect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be pushed if
it has no guards or any positive guards match the currently
selected guard, but will not be pushed if any negative guards
match the current guard. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qguard foo.patch \-\- \-stable    (negative guard)
qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
qselect stable
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This activates the "stable" guard. mq will skip foo.patch (because
it has a negative match) but push bar.patch (because it has a
positive match).
.sp
With no arguments, prints the currently active guards.
With one argument, sets the active guard.
.sp
Use \-n/\-\-none to deactivate guards (no other arguments needed).
When no guards are active, patches with positive guards are
skipped and patches with negative guards are pushed.
.sp
qselect can change the guards on applied patches. It does not pop
guarded patches by default. Use \-\-pop to pop back to the last
applied patch that is not guarded. Use \-\-reapply (which implies
\-\-pop) to push back to the current patch afterwards, but skip
guarded patches.
.sp

The strip command removes the specified changesets and all their
descendants. If the working directory has uncommitted changes, the
operation is aborted unless the \-\-force flag is supplied, in which
case changes will be discarded.
.sp
If a parent of the working directory is stripped, then the working
directory will automatically be updated to the most recent
available ancestor of the stripped parent after the operation
completes.
.sp
Any stripped changesets are stored in \fB.hg/strip\-backup\fP as a
bundle (see \%\fBhg help bundle\fP\: and \%\fBhg help unbundle\fP\:). They can
be restored by running \%\fBhg unbundle .hg/strip\-backup/BUNDLE\fP\:,
where BUNDLE is the bundle file created by the strip. Note that
the local revision numbers will in general be different after the
restore.

.SS notify
.sp
hooks for sending email push notifications
.sp
This extension let you run hooks sending email notifications when
changesets are being pushed, from the sending or receiving side.
.sp
First, enable the extension as explained in \%\fBhg help extensions\fP\:, and
register the hook you want to run. \fBincoming\fP and \fBoutgoing\fP hooks
are run by the changesets receiver while the \fBoutgoing\fP one is for
the sender:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[hooks]
# one email for each incoming changeset
incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
# one email for all incoming changesets
changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

# one email for all outgoing changesets
outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Now the hooks are running, subscribers must be assigned to
repositories. Use the \fB[usersubs]\fP section to map repositories to a
given email or the \fB[reposubs]\fP section to map emails to a single
repository:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[usersubs]
# key is subscriber email, value is a comma\-separated list of glob
# patterns
user@host = pattern

[reposubs]
# key is glob pattern, value is a comma\-separated list of subscriber
# emails
pattern = user@host
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Glob patterns are matched against absolute path to repository
root. The subscriptions can be defined in their own file and
referenced with:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[notify]
config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Alternatively, they can be added to Mercurial configuration files by
setting the previous entry to an empty value.
.sp
At this point, notifications should be generated but will not be sent until you
set the \fBnotify.test\fP entry to \fBFalse\fP.
.sp
Notifications content can be tweaked with the following configuration entries:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B notify.test
.
If \fBTrue\fP, print messages to stdout instead of sending them. Default: True.
.TP
.B notify.sources
.
Space separated list of change sources. Notifications are sent only
if it includes the incoming or outgoing changes source. Incoming
sources can be \fBserve\fP for changes coming from http or ssh,
\fBpull\fP for pulled changes, \fBunbundle\fP for changes added by
\%\fBhg unbundle\fP\: or \fBpush\fP for changes being pushed
locally. Outgoing sources are the same except for \fBunbundle\fP which
is replaced by \fBbundle\fP. Default: serve.
.TP
.B notify.strip
.
Number of leading slashes to strip from url paths. By default, notifications
references repositories with their absolute path. \fBnotify.strip\fP let you
turn them into relative paths. For example, \fBnotify.strip=3\fP will change
\fB/long/path/repository\fP into \fBrepository\fP. Default: 0.
.TP
.B notify.domain
.
If subscribers emails or the from email have no domain set, complete them
with this value.
.TP
.B notify.style
.
Style file to use when formatting emails.
.TP
.B notify.template
.
Template to use when formatting emails.
.TP
.B notify.incoming
.
Template to use when run as incoming hook, override \fBnotify.template\fP.
.TP
.B notify.outgoing
.
Template to use when run as outgoing hook, override \fBnotify.template\fP.
.TP
.B notify.changegroup
.
Template to use when running as changegroup hook, override
\fBnotify.template\fP.
.TP
.B notify.maxdiff
.
Maximum number of diff lines to include in notification email. Set to 0
to disable the diff, \-1 to include all of it. Default: 300.
.TP
.B notify.maxsubject
.
Maximum number of characters in emails subject line. Default: 67.
.TP
.B notify.diffstat
.
Set to True to include a diffstat before diff content. Default: True.
.TP
.B notify.merge
.
If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default: True.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If set, the following entries will also be used to customize the notifications:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B email.from
.
Email \fBFrom\fP address to use if none can be found in generated email content.
.TP
.B web.baseurl
.
Root repository browsing URL to combine with repository paths when making
references. See also \fBnotify.strip\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SS pager
.sp
browse command output with an external pager
.sp
To set the pager that should be used, set the application variable:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[pager]
pager = less \-FRSX
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If no pager is set, the pager extensions uses the environment variable
$PAGER. If neither pager.pager, nor $PAGER is set, no pager is used.
.sp
If you notice "BROKEN PIPE" error messages, you can disable them by
setting:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[pager]
quiet = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can disable the pager for certain commands by adding them to the
pager.ignore list:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[pager]
ignore = version, help, update
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can also enable the pager only for certain commands using
pager.attend. Below is the default list of commands to be paged:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[pager]
attend = annotate, cat, diff, export, glog, log, qdiff
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Setting pager.attend to an empty value will cause all commands to be
paged.
.sp
If pager.attend is present, pager.ignore will be ignored.
.sp
To ignore global commands like \%\fBhg version\fP\: or \%\fBhg help\fP\:, you have
to specify them in your user configuration file.
.sp
The \-\-pager=... option can also be used to control when the pager is
used. Use a boolean value like yes, no, on, off, or use auto for
normal behavior.
.SS patchbomb
.sp
command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails
.sp
The series is started off with a "[PATCH 0 of N]" introduction, which
describes the series as a whole.
.sp
Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using the
first line of the changeset description as the subject text. The
message contains two or three body parts:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
The changeset description.
.IP \(bu 2
.
[Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.
.IP \(bu 2
.
The patch itself, as generated by \%\fBhg export\fP\:.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each message refers to the first in the series using the In\-Reply\-To
and References headers, so they will show up as a sequence in threaded
mail and news readers, and in mail archives.
.sp
To configure other defaults, add a section like this to your
configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[email]
from = My Name <my@email>
to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
cc = cc1, cc2, ...
bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
reply\-to = address1, address2, ...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Use \fB[patchbomb]\fP as configuration section name if you need to
override global \fB[email]\fP address settings.
.sp
Then you can use the \%\fBhg email\fP\: command to mail a series of
changesets as a patchbomb.
.sp
You can also either configure the method option in the email section
to be a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp] section so
that the patchbomb extension can automatically send patchbombs
directly from the commandline. See the [email] and [smtp] sections in
hgrc(5) for details.
.SS Commands
.SS email
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg email [OPTION]... [DEST]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by
\%\fBhg export\fP\:, one per message. The series starts with a "[PATCH 0
of N]" introduction, which describes the series as a whole.
.sp
Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using
the first line of the changeset description as the subject text.
The message contains two or three parts. First, the changeset
description.
.sp
With the \-d/\-\-diffstat option, if the diffstat program is
installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch is inserted.
.sp
Finally, the patch itself, as generated by \%\fBhg export\fP\:.
.sp
With the \-d/\-\-diffstat or \-c/\-\-confirm options, you will be presented
with a final summary of all messages and asked for confirmation before
the messages are sent.
.sp
By default the patch is included as text in the email body for
easy reviewing. Using the \-a/\-\-attach option will instead create
an attachment for the patch. With \-i/\-\-inline an inline attachment
will be created.
.sp
With \-o/\-\-outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not found
in the destination repository (or only those which are ancestors
of the specified revisions if any are provided)
.sp
With \-b/\-\-bundle, changesets are selected as for \-\-outgoing, but a
single email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an attachment
will be sent.
.sp
With \-m/\-\-mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in a
pager or sending the messages directly, it will create a UNIX
mailbox file with the patch emails. This mailbox file can be
previewed with any mail user agent which supports UNIX mbox
files.
.sp
With \-n/\-\-test, all steps will run, but mail will not be sent.
You will be prompted for an email recipient address, a subject and
an introductory message describing the patches of your patchbomb.
Then when all is done, patchbomb messages are displayed. If the
PAGER environment variable is set, your pager will be fired up once
for each patchbomb message, so you can verify everything is alright.
.sp
In case email sending fails, you will find a backup of your series
introductory message in \fB.hg/last\-email.txt\fP.
.sp

.sp

.SS progress
.sp
show progress bars for some actions
.sp
This extension uses the progress information logged by hg commands
to draw progress bars that are as informative as possible. Some progress
bars only offer indeterminate information, while others have a definite
end point.
.sp
The following settings are available:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[progress]
delay = 3 # number of seconds (float) before showing the progress bar
changedelay = 1 # changedelay: minimum delay before showing a new topic.
                # If set to less than 3 * refresh, that value will
                # be used instead.
refresh = 0.1 # time in seconds between refreshes of the progress bar
format = topic bar number estimate # format of the progress bar
width = <none> # if set, the maximum width of the progress information
               # (that is, min(width, term width) will be used)
clear\-complete = True # clear the progress bar after it\(aqs done
disable = False # if true, don\(aqt show a progress bar
assume\-tty = False # if true, ALWAYS show a progress bar, unless
                   # disable is given
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Valid entries for the format field are topic, bar, number, unit,
estimate, speed, and item. item defaults to the last 20 characters of
the item, but this can be changed by adding either \fB\-<num>\fP which
would take the last num characters, or \fB+<num>\fP for the first num
characters.
.SS purge
.sp
command to delete untracked files from the working directory
.SS Commands
.SS purge
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg purge [OPTION]... [DIR]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Delete files not known to Mercurial. This is useful to test local
and uncommitted changes in an otherwise\-clean source tree.
.sp
This means that purge will delete:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

Unknown files: files marked with "?" by \%\fBhg status\fP\:
.IP \(bu 2
.
Empty directories: in fact Mercurial ignores directories unless
they contain files under source control management
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
If directories are given on the command line, only files in these
directories are considered.
.sp
Be careful with purge, as you could irreversibly delete some files
you forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to print the
list of files that this program would delete, use the \-\-print
option.

.SS rebase
.sp
command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor
.sp
This extension lets you rebase changesets in an existing Mercurial
repository.
.sp
For more information:
\%http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension\:
.SS Commands
.SS rebase
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase [\-s REV | \-b REV] [\-d REV] [options]
hg rebase {\-a|\-c}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of
history (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be
useful for linearizing \fIlocal\fP changes relative to a master
development tree.
.sp
You should not rebase changesets that have already been shared
with others. Doing so will force everybody else to perform the
same rebase or they will end up with duplicated changesets after
pulling in your rebased changesets.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a destination changeset (\fB\-d/\-\-dest\fP),
rebase uses the tipmost head of the current named branch as the
destination. (The destination changeset is not modified by
rebasing, but new changesets are added as its descendants.)
.sp
You can specify which changesets to rebase in two ways: as a
"source" changeset or as a "base" changeset. Both are shorthand
for a topologically related set of changesets (the "source
branch"). If you specify source (\fB\-s/\-\-source\fP), rebase will
rebase that changeset and all of its descendants onto dest. If you
specify base (\fB\-b/\-\-base\fP), rebase will select ancestors of base
back to but not including the common ancestor with dest. Thus,
\fB\-b\fP is less precise but more convenient than \fB\-s\fP: you can
specify any changeset in the source branch, and rebase will select
the whole branch. If you specify neither \fB\-s\fP nor \fB\-b\fP, rebase
uses the parent of the working directory as the base.
.sp
By default, rebase recreates the changesets in the source branch
as descendants of dest and then destroys the originals. Use
\fB\-\-keep\fP to preserve the original source changesets. Some
changesets in the source branch (e.g. merges from the destination
branch) may be dropped if they no longer contribute any change.
.sp
One result of the rules for selecting the destination changeset
and source branch is that, unlike \fBmerge\fP, rebase will do
nothing if you are at the latest (tipmost) head of a named branch
with two heads. You need to explicitly specify source and/or
destination (or \fBupdate\fP to the other head, if it\(aqs the head of
the intended source branch).
.sp
If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a merge, it can be
continued with \-\-continue/\-c or aborted with \-\-abort/\-a.
.sp
Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to rebase.

.SS relink
.sp
recreates hardlinks between repository clones
.SS Commands
.SS relink
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg relink [ORIGIN]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When repositories are cloned locally, their data files will be
hardlinked so that they only use the space of a single repository.
.sp
Unfortunately, subsequent pulls into either repository will break
hardlinks for any files touched by the new changesets, even if
both repositories end up pulling the same changes.
.sp
Similarly, passing \-\-rev to "hg clone" will fail to use any
hardlinks, falling back to a complete copy of the source
repository.
.sp
This command lets you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that
wasted space.
.sp
This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN, which
must be on the same local disk. If ORIGIN is omitted, looks for
"default\-relink", then "default", in [paths].
.sp
Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while the
command is running. (Both repositories will be locked against
writes.)
.SS schemes
.sp
extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms
.sp
This extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a
lot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[schemes]
py = http://code.python.org/hg/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
After that you can use it like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg clone py://trunk/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for
example used by Google Code:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[schemes]
gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited
number of variables, starting with \fB{1}\fP and continuing with
\fB{2}\fP, \fB{3}\fP and so on. This variables will receive parts of URL
supplied, split by \fB/\fP. Anything not specified as \fB{part}\fP will be
just appended to an URL.
.sp
For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[schemes]
py = http://hg.python.org/
bb = https://bitbucket.org/
bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme with the
same name.
.SS share
.sp
share a common history between several working directories
.SS Commands
.SS share
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg share [\-U] SOURCE [DEST]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its
history with another repository.
.IP Note
.
using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (mq,
rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared
clones. In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to
the same changeset, and one of them destroys that changeset
with rollback, the other clone will suddenly stop working: all
operations will fail with "abort: working directory has unknown
parent". The only known workaround is to use debugsetparents on
the broken clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists
(e.g. tip).

.SS transplant
.sp
command to transplant changesets from another branch
.sp
This extension allows you to transplant patches from another branch.
.sp
Transplanted patches are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants, as a
map from a changeset hash to its hash in the source repository.
.SS Commands
.SS transplant
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg transplant [\-s REPO] [\-b BRANCH [\-a]] [\-p REV] [\-m REV] [REV]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Selected changesets will be applied on top of the current working
directory with the log of the original changeset. The changesets
are copied and will thus appear twice in the history. Use the
rebase extension instead if you want to move a whole branch of
unpublished changesets.
.sp
If \-\-log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can rewrite the changelog message with the \-\-filter option.
Its argument will be invoked with the current changelog message as
$1 and the patch as $2.
.sp
If \-\-source/\-s is specified, selects changesets from the named
repository. If \-\-branch/\-b is specified, selects changesets from
the branch holding the named revision, up to that revision. If
\-\-all/\-a is specified, all changesets on the branch will be
transplanted, otherwise you will be prompted to select the
changesets you want.
.sp
\%\fBhg transplant \-\-branch REVISION \-\-all\fP\: will transplant the
selected branch (up to the named revision) onto your current
working directory.
.sp
You can optionally mark selected transplanted changesets as merge
changesets. You will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors
of a merged transplant, and you can merge descendants of them
normally instead of transplanting them.
.sp
If no merges or revisions are provided, \%\fBhg transplant\fP\: will
start an interactive changeset browser.
.sp
If a changeset application fails, you can fix the merge by hand
and then resume where you left off by calling \%\fBhg transplant

.SS win32mbcs
.sp
allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings
.sp
Some MBCS encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e.
splitting path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We call
such a encoding (i.e. shift_jis and big5) as "problematic encoding".
This extension can be used to fix the issue with those encodings by
wrapping some functions to convert to Unicode string before path
operation.
.sp
This extension is useful for:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.

.sp
Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
You should use single encoding in one repository.
.IP \(bu 2
.
If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.
.IP \(bu 2
.
win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by Mercurial.
You can specify the encoding by config option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[win32mbcs]
encoding = sjis
.ft P
.fi
.sp
It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF\-8 log message.
.SS win32text
.sp
perform automatic newline conversion
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
Deprecation: The win32text extension requires each user to configure
the extension again and again for each clone since the configuration
is not copied when cloning.
.sp
We have therefore made the \fBeol\fP as an alternative. The \fBeol\fP
uses a version controlled file for its configuration and each clone
will therefore use the right settings from the start.
